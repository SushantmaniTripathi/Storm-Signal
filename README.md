Storm Signal is an intelligent customer sentiment monitoring and alert system designed for support teams. It continuously scans **reviews, social media mentions, and forums** to catch early signs of negative sentiment. When urgent issues surface, Storm Signal instantly flags them and delivers real-time alerts with response recommendations via **Slack** or **Email**—helping teams stay ahead of potential escalations.
